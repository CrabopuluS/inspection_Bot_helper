# Personal Website

This repository contains a simple multi-page website built with React, Tailwind CSS and a Node.js backend.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install

# Build client
npm run build

# Install server dependencies
cd ../server
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

The server serves the built React app and exposes a sample API endpoint at `/api/hello`.
